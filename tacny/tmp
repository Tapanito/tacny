take an existing match as see how to generate it
generate as big of a search space as possible to get 
look into parallel forall to paralelize execution
finish analysis
look into richer perm 
lazy eval
heuristic search, tactic line count and possible branching factor as heuristics

identify the problem
look for similar work to compare with

meat: design, how it was evaluated, experiments

existing work: compare with existing work on lazy eval, tactics in theorem provers, meta level programming

tactic level expressions

add returns()

ensure when tactic is called from method the added variables are ghost
